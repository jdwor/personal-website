  I am a senior program associate in the Abundance and Growth Fund at Open Philanthropy, where I lead our grantmaking on Innovation Policy. In this role, and in general, I work to identify and support efforts to accelerate scientific progress and innovation, and am motivated by the broader goals of improving scientific research, funding, institutions, and incentive structures through experimentation.
