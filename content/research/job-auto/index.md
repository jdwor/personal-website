## Description

The potential for widespread job automation has become an important topic of discussion in recent years, and it is thought that many American workers may need to learn new skills or transition to new jobs to maintain stable positions in the workforce. Because workersâ€™ existing skills may make such transitions more or less difficult, the likelihood of a given job being automated only tells part of the story. As such, this article exploresthe links between jobs that arise from their necessary skills, knowledge and abilities. The resulting links reveal the expected benefit of specific job transitions, and demonstrate that consideration of shared skills yields better transition recommendations than automatability and job growth alone.
