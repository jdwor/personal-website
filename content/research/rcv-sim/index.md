## Description

Following the 2016 presidential primaries, I attempted to explore the possible outcomes under ranked-choice voting. Using early polls that asked voters for their second-choice candidates, as well as the number of votes cast for each candidate in each primary, I simulated what might have happened in the first 15 Republican primaries and caucuses under an RCV system. Simulations show only modest changes under RCV, with some consolidation against Trump in specific states, but not an overwhelming change in outcomes.
