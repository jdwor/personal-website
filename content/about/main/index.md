  I am an associate program officer in the Abundance and Growth Fund at [Coefficient Giving](https://coefficientgiving.org/), where I lead our grantmaking on [Innovation Policy](https://coefficientgiving.org/funds/abundance-and-growth/innovation-policy/). In this role, I aim to identify and support efforts to safely accelerate scientific progress and innovation. I am motivated by the broader goals of improving scientific research, funding, institutions, and incentive structures through creativity and experimentation, and I am always excited to connect with others who share those goals (feel free to reach out at jordan.dworkin@coefficientgiving.org).
  
  Before joining Coefficient Giving, I was the Metascience Program Lead at the Federation of American Scientists, and an Assistant Professor of Clinical Biostatistics at Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. My work has spanned metascience, science policy, evidence synthesis, and neuroimaging statistics.
